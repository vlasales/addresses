# PHP assignment

This is the basic structure of the project, feel free to extend it in any way you like.

## Directory structure

```
data/       - base set of data that we used to set up your database
logs/       - log files
public/     - accessible via web-server
spec/       - assignment
src/        - source codes for your assignment
vendor/     - third party libraries
```

You should implement your solution in `/src` directory.
 
## Database

You should fill in database credentials you've received in `src/settings.php`.
